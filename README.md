# Solar-Tracker

One-axis solar tracker to fully optimize the light intensity as the solar panel can be rotated +-180 degree for better absorption of energy.


Components used:
- 1 servo motor
- Solar Cell/Panel 12V 250mA (3W)
- Arduino Uno (can be replaced by other microcontrollers, however coding may varies)
- 2 Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)
- 2 10K resistors
